# AdvancedWelcome
AdvancedWelcome is a minecraft pe pocketmine 3.9.3 api plugin. So, basically, this plugin will send a message when a player joins (message can be edited in config.yml in plugin_data). This is my first plugin on poggit, so there will be more releases and if you have any complaints, please comment them below.
